---------

Welcome! My name is **Ivan Bongiorni**, I'm a **Data Scientist** from Italy.
<br/> During my **PhD** at the **University of Milan** I developed a background in Statistical methods for the social sciences.
In 2016 I became **Visiting PhD scholar** at the **University of Michigan**, Ann Arbor MI.
<br/> Since 2018 I've been working for a **market research** company where I apply Machine Learning to predict consumer behavior.

My plan is to fill this blog with AI and ML-releted things that I find interesting.
