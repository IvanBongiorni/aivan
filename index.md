Welcome! My name is **Ivan Bongiorni**, I'm a **Data Scientist** from Italy. <br/> During my **PhD** at the **University of Milan** I developed a background in Statistics and Econometrics applied to social sciences. In 2016 I became **Visiting PhD scholar** at the **University of Michigan**, Ann Arbor MI. Since 2018 I've been working for a **market research** company where I apply Machine Learning to understand and forecast consumer behavior.

My plan is to fill this blog with AI and ML-releted things that I find interesting.
